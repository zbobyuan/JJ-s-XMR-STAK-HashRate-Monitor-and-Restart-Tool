Releae Date: 2018-05-12
Notes:  RX580 enhanced startup control

Changes:
        Now checks for STAK hanging on startup and allow a configurable amount of retries before rebooting pc
            enabled by setting STAKMaxStartAttampts > 0
        Enabled full display driver reset for supported cards at launch if card reset enabled
            RX580's sometimes don't show driver error until they have been reset once and just play-up in the meantime
            This does not change targeted reset during runtime behaviour
