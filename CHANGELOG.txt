    Profit switching functionality extention as it now supports per coin
        amd.txt, nvida.txt, cpu.txt , this allows you to mine a coin and figure out best parameters such as intensity
        minhashrate, Not all coins mine the same rate
        hdiff, hashdrop setting
        nanoipoolapi moved into main script so only a single executable is needed
        if grafana is enabled and influx database modules are not installed script will prompt for instalation permision

Note
    If you enable profit switching you MUST create default_amd.txt, default_nvida.txt and default_cpu.txt config files
        These will be used if you do not specify anything in the pool config.


Version 4.3.4
Release Date 2018-07-04

Changes:
    Added pool switching based on profit stats from http://minecryptonight.net/, Triggered at startup and at restart
    of miner, Uses 1Hr stats, stats are saved in the folder as profit.json if you want to review these are also in your
    logfiles
    Added dead thread check for when xmr-stak is returning null data due to dead thread, triggers card restart and test
    Added generate_pool_json.ps1 This creates an example pools.json file for profit switching


Notes
    generate_pool_json.ps1, right mouse click and choose run with powershell
    This generates an example pools.json using my own pools,  whilst I would be grateful for some hashes this is here
    to create an example pools.json file for you to edit you are welcome to use them for testing

    You can edit either the powershell script or the pools.json file depending on your preference
    however you must ensure you comment out entire sections

    pools.json = can have items commented out using / or #  sections start { and end with }, these are verticaly aligned
    generate_pool_json.ps1 = standard powershell commenting

    if you get a failure to read file message you have made a mistake, if its a bug please report via slack channel

Version 4.3.0
Release Date: 2018-06-16
Notes:
    If your using Nanopool this will now report poolside stats, prices and predicted profability, it does this by
    reading your wallet address and worker id from your pools.txt file, please disable nanopool stats if you do
    not wish this to happen, this information is not sent anywhere, I respect yuor privacy if you have any concerns
    please contact me

    If you have another pool which you would like included in a future release please add a request with the url
    for their api documentation

    improved device reset code, introduced third party app to test gpu's named 'clinfo.exe', I have included this as an
    executable however you can also compile from source

Changes:
    Added nanopool api refresh rate, minnimum 10, default 30, too often and you will be blocked
    Added clinfo utility to query opencl devices after a reset, exposes error's before trying to start STAK if theres
        issues, using this to work around the wmi refresh issue that causes devices to show as ok when they are in error
    Removed additonal card test and 15 second wait time after device reset as clinfo takes care of exposing device errors
    Logging device reset times changed to notification level 4, set your notification level to at least 4 to send this data

Required
    clinfo.exe, executable included, Source https://github.com/Oblomov/clinfo
    Personally scanned with malware Bytes, Please report any false positives from any software ASAP.

Version 4.2.18
Release Date: 2018-06-10
Notes:

Changes:
    Logging device reset times with a view to an additional way of capturing device restart issues
        This is set to always show on Slack if enabled with a view to me correlating these times of our miners to find a good default setting and this allows you to set maxDeviceResetTime
    maxDeviceResetTime, if disabling a device takes longer than this the device is concidered in error state, in seconds will reboot if enabled, default 2

Version 4.2.17
Release Date: 2018-06-01
Notes:
    Issue found with the way devices are reset, driver reports ok for a while after a reset
        a 15 second pause and additional card test when ResetCardOnStartup is activated appears to capture this
        please let me know of any issues with this via Slack channel happy to asist where I can

Changes:
    Added addidional test and a pause of 15 seconds on startup to all display drivers to update
    Added temporary connection failure alerts and logging
    negated redundant reset cards on startup

	Introduced alertLevel setting to control verbosity of Slack massages, Defaults to 1
    Reccomend that Grafana is run on a different host than any of your miners but will work locally, not a good idea
