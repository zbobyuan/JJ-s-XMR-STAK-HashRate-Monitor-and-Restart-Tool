Version 4.2.8
Releae Date: 2018-05-15
Notes:  Integrated notifications, Come say hi https://join.slack.com/t/hashmonitor/signup

Changes:
    Changed card reset on startup to be a user configurable item
    Integrated Slack and email notifications, Key startup and error values only,
        Warning SMS's are single item messages which can be prolific, enable with caution


Version 4.2.6
Releae Date: 2018-05-12
Notes:  RX580 enhanced startup control

Changes:
        Now checks for STAK hanging on startup and allow a configurable amount of retries before rebooting pc
            enabled by setting STAKMaxStartAttampts > 0
        Enabled full display driver reset for supported cards at launch if card reset enabled
            RX580's sometimes don't show driver error until they have been reset once and just play-up in the meantime
            This does not change targeted reset during runtime behaviour



Version 4.2.5
Releae Date: 2018-05-05

        10 second timeout during startup to catch xmr-stak issues
        disables crossfire at launch for Vega's
