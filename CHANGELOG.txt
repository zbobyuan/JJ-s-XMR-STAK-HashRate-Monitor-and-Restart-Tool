Version 4.3.1
Release Date: 2018-06-23

Changes:
    Added    Radeon (TM) RX 470 Graphics & Radeon (TM) RX 480 Graphics card reset support


Version 4.3.0
Release Date: 2018-06-16
Notes:
    If your using Nanopool this will now report poolside stats, prices and predicted profability, it does this by
    reading your wallet address and worker id from your pools.txt file, please disable nanopool stats if you do
    not wish this to happen, this information is not sent anywhere, I respect yuor privacy if you have any concerns
    please contact me

    If you have another pool which you would like included in a future release please add a request with the url
    for their api documentation

    improved device reset code, introduced third party app to test gpu's named 'clinfo.exe', I have included this as an
    executable however you can also compile from source

Changes:
    Added nanopool api refresh rate, minnimum 10, default 30, too often and you will be blocked
    Added clinfo utility to query opencl devices after a reset, exposes error's before trying to start STAK if theres
        issues, using this to work around the wmi refresh issue that causes devices to show as ok when they are in error
    Removed additonal card test and 15 second wait time after device reset as clinfo takes care of exposing device errors
    Logging device reset times changed to notification level 4, set your notification level to at least 4 to send this data

Required
    clinfo.exe, executable included, Source https://github.com/Oblomov/clinfo
    Personally scanned with malware Bytes, Please report anti false positives from any software ASAP.

Version 4.2.19
Release Date: 2018-06-15
Notes:

Changes:
    Added nanopool api functionality to track poolside stats, prices and predicted profability features to grafana when using that pool


Version 4.2.18
Release Date: 2018-06-10
Notes:

Changes:
    Logging device reset times with a view to an additional way of capturing device restart issues
        This is set to always show on Slack if enabled with a view to me correlating these times of our miners to find a good default setting and this allows you to set maxDeviceResetTime
    maxDeviceResetTime, if disabling a device takes longer than this the device is concidered in error state, in seconds will reboot if enabled, default 2

Version 4.2.17
Release Date: 2018-06-01
Notes:
    Issue found with the way devices are reset, driver reports ok for a while after a reset
        a 15 second pause and additional card test when ResetCardOnStartup is activated appears to capture this
        please let me know of any issues with this via Slack channel happy to asist where I can

Changes:
    Added addidional test and a pause of 15 seconds on startup to all display drivers to update
    Added temporary connection failure alerts and logging
    negated redundant reset cards on startup


Version 4.2.16
Release Date: ---
Notes:
    Reboot rule change
    ** Warning Vega's can throw error that starts with hashdrop and ends with       **
    ** fans going crazy and eventually BSOD a controlled reboot stops this issue.   **
    ** strongly suggest you enable reboots to protect your cards                    **

Changes:
    reboot rule enhancements, always respect reboot rules no matter whats happening,
    elevated low hash rate alert and modified to always report hash rates when it does
    corrected typo in progressPreference variable
    added ErrorActionPreference and set to silentlyContinue

Notes: 
	Current Slack invite is https://join.slack.com/t/hashmonitor/shared_invite/enQtMzcxNDgyMjQ1NzUxLWY2NTA2NDdmNDBhM2QyNzIyNzgyYjNjMjFjYzA3NDZiNDFmYjVjYjEwMWZjNWZiYWUyZDM5OWVkNDY5MmJmMzM
	Introduced alertLevel setting to control verbosity of Slack massages, Defaults to 1
    Reccomend that Grafana is run on a different host than any of your miners but will work locally, not a good idea
        when your rebooting the host, You can use an internet based service

Changes:
        Now checks for STAK hanging on startup and allow a configurable amount of retries before rebooting pc
            enabled by setting STAKMaxStartAttampts > 0
        Enabled full display driver reset for supported cards at launch if card reset enabled
            RX580's sometimes don't show driver error until they have been reset once and just play-up in the meantime
            This does not change targeted reset during runtime behaviour
