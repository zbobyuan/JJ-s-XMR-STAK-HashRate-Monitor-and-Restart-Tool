Come say hi 

https://join.slack.com/t/hashmonitor/shared_invite/enQtMzcxNDgyMjQ1NzUxLWY2NTA2NDdmNDBhM2QyNzIyNzgyYjNjMjFjYzA3NDZiNDFmYjVjYjEwMWZjNWZiYWUyZDM5OWVkNDY5MmJmMzM

Please see changelog for a detailed enhancement list.

I initally modified this script for myself after having issues with the amount of dev-mining in other versions due to frequent hash-drops whilst getting my Vega config spot on 

There is an executable version of this script in the releases folder if you prefer that to powershell, 

Please remember to launch as admin for better XMR-STAK performance and to be able to reset display cards

Please feel free to provide feedback and enhancement Idea's as your contributions are welcomed

For additonal cards to be supported by default please provide me the friendly names found by running the following powershell command on the destination system
    Get-PnpDevice -Class Display
