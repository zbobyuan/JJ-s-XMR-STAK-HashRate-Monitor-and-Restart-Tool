I'm still maintaining this repo just re-writing it in Golang
https://github.com/mutl3y/goHashmonitor

Written to keep your miner hashing and taking care of card issues before they become a problem. You can use this in mixed AMD and Nvidia rigs however card resets are restricted to AMD devices, if you have an Nvidia card that exhibits hashdrop that is fixed by reseting the card please provide details for it to become supported.

Slack Group for support, Idea's and a place to view your miners logs in realtime should you wish to join in

Script now incorporates profit switching using predetermined pools set by you,  **Please see ProfitReadme.md for further info**

Nanopool api (All Coins) , Pol, side ststs displayed toi screen and grafana if configured
    
I initally modified this script for myself after having issues with the amount of dev-mining in other versions due to frequent hash-drops whilst getting my Vega config spot on 

There is an executable version of this script in the releases folder if you prefer that to powershell, 

Please remember to launch as admin for better XMR-STAK performance and to be able to reset display cards

Please feel free to provide feedback and enhancement Idea's as your contributions are welcomed

For additonal cards to be supported by default please provide me the friendly names found by running the following powershell command on the destination system
    Get-PnpDevice -Class Display 

By default this script sends basic logging info into the Hashmonitor Slack channel, to disable this simply comment out the SlackURL in the hashmonitor.ini file, If you wish to view your logs in the hashmonitor channel please send me a request via Slack to join with your miners hostname and I will add you into our channel
